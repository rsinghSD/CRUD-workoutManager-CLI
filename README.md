# Just a CRUD Workout Manager

CRUD DotNet application allowing the user to perform CRUD operations with a application. This project is split in two phases:

- [x] Phase 1: Create a CRUD application as a console application in C#
- [ ] Phase 2: Intregrate Avalonia UI Framework for a graphical application

So what does it do?
As a user, you can perform the following actions:
* Create a excercise through a guided step-for-step onboarding
* Retrieve excercises created saved in a .json format
* Create a workout, which can contain multiple excercises
* Retrieve a workout, saved in a .json as well
* Update excercises/workouts
* Remove excercises/workouts

## (personal) To-Do List
### Phase One
**'Backend' implementation**
- [x] Project initialization
- [x] Create A Excercise
- [x] Implement Builder Pattern at Create
- [x] Read Operation
- [x] Get Writing/Reading .json files working
- [x] Create Workout. One workout = multiple excercises
- [x] Read Workout. Same .json method
- [x] Edit existing excercies (use the same builder pattern?)
- [x] Edit existing workouts
- [x] Remove Excercises/Workouts
- [x] ~~Create a Calendar (Use a package..?) and add the possibility to add workouts to it~~
- [x] ICal Intregration (.ics file)

### Phase Two
**'Frontend' inplementation**
- [ ] Get familiar with Avalonia UI
- [ ] Do some Research on tool dashboard UI's. Find websites that offer UI examples
- [ ] Create a Figma Design for the frontend website. (Use Avalonia UI examples for the best success given time).
- [ ] Create the Front-End
- [ ] Design a dashboard-like interface.
## Tech Stack
Do people these days actually share their entire stack developing programs? I think it's nice to have in a documentation, just to let others know how I coded this program.

## Disclaimer
**Typo Disclaimer**: *I understand that seeing 'Excercise' and 'Exercise' in the code base is a huge mistake I've made, it's pretty unprofessional. I will fix this in the front-end, but the Console App will stay like this for now.*. 
**AI Usage Disclaimer**: *AI was mostly used for help with complex parts such as serializing JSON, learning how Reflection works etc... aside from that, youtube videos, and Microsoft docs/GeeksForGeeks/W3Schools was used. Oh btw, ChatGPT created this cool bannner at the start of the page :)*
